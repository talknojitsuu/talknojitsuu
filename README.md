- 👋 Hi, I’m @talknojitsuu
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and creating programs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how this coding stuff works 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects 
-I would like to know how to code. I can picture myself using this in the future and would like to get a job in the porgramming/coding world if that makes any sense.
